This guide shows how you can 1) access the set of prompts for any module (including nested) with get_prompts, and 2) update these prompts easily with update_prompts. If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙. Here we build a vector index over a toy dataset (PG’s essay), and access the query engine. The query engine is a simple RAG pipeline consisting of top-k retrieval + LLM synthesis. Download Data Here we get the prompts from the query engine. Note that all prompts are returned, including ones used in sub-modules in the query engine. This allows you to centralize a view of these prompts! Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:summary_templateText:   You can also call get_prompts on the underlying response synthesizer, where you’ll see the same list. Prompt Key: summary_templateText:   Here we try the default compact method. We’ll see that the set of templates used are different; a QA template and a refine template. Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:text_qa_templateText:   Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:refine_templateText:   You can also update/customize the prompts with the update_prompts function. Pass in arg values with the keys equal to the keys you see in the prompt dictionary. Here we’ll change the summary prompt to use Shakespeare. Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:summary_templateText:   Here we take a look at some other modules: query engines, routers/selectors, evaluators, and others.

If the context isn't useful, return the original answer. Refined Answer: response = query_engine.query("What did the author do growing up?") print(str(response)) The author worked on writing and programming outside of school before college. They wrote short stories and tried writing programs on an IBM 1401 computer using an early version of Fortran. They later got a microcomputer and started programming on it, writing simple games and a word processor. They also mentioned their interest in philosophy and AI. from llama_index.prompts import PromptTemplate # reset # shakespeare! new_summary_tmpl_str = ( "Context information is below.\n" "---------------------\n" "{context_str}\n" "Given the context information and not prior knowledge, " "answer the query in the style of a Shakespeare play.\n" "Query: {query_str}\n" "Answer: " new_summary_tmpl = PromptTemplate(new_summary_tmpl_str) query_engine.update_prompts( {"response_synthesizer:summary_template": new_summary_tmpl} Given the context information and not prior knowledge, answer the query in the style of a Shakespeare play. from llama_index.query_engine import ( RouterQueryEngine, FLAREInstructQueryEngine, from llama_index.selectors import LLMMultiSelector from llama_index.evaluation import FaithfulnessEvaluator, DatasetGenerator from llama_index.indices.postprocessor import LLMRerank # setup sample router query engine from llama_index.tools.query_engine import QueryEngineTool query_tool = QueryEngineTool.from_defaults( query_engine=query_engine, description="test description" router_query_engine = RouterQueryEngine.from_defaults([query_tool]) prompts_dict = router_query_engine.get_prompts() flare_query_engine = FLAREInstructQueryEngine(query_engine) prompts_dict = flare_query_engine.get_prompts() Skill 1. Use the Search API to look up relevant information by writing     "[Search(query)]" where "query" is the search query you want to look up.     For example: Query: But what are the risks during production of nanomaterials? Answer: [Search(What are some nanomaterial production risks?)] Query: The colors on the flag of Ghana have the following meanings. Answer: Red is for [Search(What is the meaning of Ghana's flag being red?)],     green for forests, and gold for mineral wealth. Query: What did the author do during his time in college? Answer: The author took classes in [Search(What classes did the author take in     college?)]. Skill 2. Solve more complex generation tasks by thinking step by step. For example: Query: Give a summary of the author's life and career. Answer: The author was born in 1990. Growing up, he [Search(What did the     author do during his childhood?)]. Query: Can you write a summary of the Great Gatsby. Answer: The Great Gatsby is a novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is about     [Search(What is the Great Gatsby about?)]. Now given the following task, and the stub of an existing answer, generate the next portion of the answer. You may use the Search API "[Search(query)]" whenever possible. If the answer is complete and no longer contains any "[Search(query)]" tags, write     "done" to finish the task. Do not write "done" if the answer still contains "[Search(query)]" tags. Do not make up answers. It is better to generate one "[Search(query)]" tag and stop generation than to fill in the answer with made up information with no "[Search(query)]" tags or multiple "[Search(query)]" tags that assume a structure in the answer. Try to limit generation to one sentence if possible. Existing Answer: {existing_answer} An existing 'lookahead response' is given below. The lookahead response contains `[Search(query)]` tags. Some queries have been executed and the response retrieved. The queries and answers are also given below. Also the previous response (the response before the lookahead response) is given below. Given the lookahead template, previous response, and also queries and answers, please 'fill in' the lookahead template with the appropriate answers. NOTE: Please make sure that the final response grammatically follows the previous response + lookahead template. For example, if the previous response is "New York City has a population of " and the lookahead template is "[Search(What is the population of New York City?)]", then the final response should be "8.4 million". NOTE: the lookahead template may not be a complete sentence and may contain trailing/leading commas, etc. Please preserve the original formatting of the lookahead template if possible. NOTE: NOTE: the exception to the above rule is if the answer to a query is equivalent to "I don't know" or "I don't have an answer". In this case, modify the lookahead template to indicate that the answer is not known. NOTE: the lookahead template may contain multiple `[Search(query)]` tags and only a subset of these queries have been executed. Do not replace the `[Search(query)]` tags that have not been executed. Previous Response: Lookahead Template: Red is for [Search(What is the meaning of Ghana's     flag being red?)], green for forests, and gold for mineral wealth. Query-Answer Pairs: Query: What is the meaning of Ghana's flag being red? Answer: The red represents the blood of those who died in the country's struggle     for independence Filled in Answers: Red is for the blood of those who died in the country's struggle for independence,     green for forests, and gold for mineral wealth. One of the largest cities in the world , the city contains a population of [Search(What is the population     of New York City?)] Query: What is the population of New York City? Answer: The population of New York City is 8.4 million Synthesized Response: , the city contains a population of 8.4 million the city contains a population of [Search(What is the population of New York City?)] 8.4 million {prev_response} {lookahead_response} {query_answer_pairs} from llama_index.selectors.llm_selectors import LLMSingleSelector selector = LLMSingleSelector.from_defaults() prompts_dict = selector.get_prompts() Some choices are given below. It is provided in a numbered list (1 to {num_choices}), where each item in the list corresponds to a summary. {context_list} Using only the choices above and not prior knowledge, return the choice that is most relevant to the question: '{query_str}' evaluator = FaithfulnessEvaluator() prompts_dict = evaluator.get_prompts() Please tell if a given piece of information is supported by the context. You need to answer with either YES or NO. Answer YES if any of the context supports the information, even if most of the context is unrelated. Some examples are provided below. Information: Apple pie is generally double-crusted. Context: An apple pie is a fruit pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. Apple pie is often served with whipped cream, ice cream ('apple pie à la mode'), custard or cheddar cheese. It is generally double-crusted, with pastry both above and below the filling; the upper crust may be solid or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). Answer: YES Information: Apple pies tastes bad. Answer: NO Information: {query_str} Context: {context_str} We want to understand if the following information is present in the context information: {query_str} We have provided an existing YES/NO answer: {existing_answer} If the existing answer was already YES, still answer YES.

Modules LlamaIndex contains a variety of higher-level modules (query engines, response synthesizers, retrievers, etc.), many of which make LLM calls + use prompt templates. This guide shows how you can 1) access the set of prompts for any module (including nested) with get_prompts, and 2) update these prompts easily with update_prompts. If you’re opening this Notebook on colab, you will probably need to install LlamaIndex 🦙. !pip install llama-index Setup: Load Data, Build Index, and Get Query Engine Here we build a vector index over a toy dataset (PG’s essay), and access the query engine. The query engine is a simple RAG pipeline consisting of top-k retrieval + LLM synthesis. Accessing Prompts Here we get the prompts from the query engine. Note that all prompts are returned, including ones used in sub-modules in the query engine. This allows you to centralize a view of these prompts! Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:summary_templateText: Checking get_prompts on Response Synthesizer You can also call get_prompts on the underlying response synthesizer, where you’ll see the same list. Prompt Key: summary_templateText: Checking get_prompts with a different response synthesis strategy Here we try the default compact method. We’ll see that the set of templates used are different; a QA template and a refine template. Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:text_qa_templateText: Prompt Key: response_synthesizer:refine_templateText: Put into query engine, get response Customize the prompt You can also update/customize the prompts with the update_prompts function. Pass in arg values with the keys equal to the keys you see in the prompt dictionary. Here we’ll change the summary prompt to use Shakespeare. Accessing Prompts from Other Modules Here we take a look at some other modules: query engines, routers/selectors, evaluators, and others. Analyze Prompts: Router Query Engine Prompt Key: summarizer:summary_templateText: Analyze Prompts: FLARE Query Engine Prompt Key: instruct_promptText: Prompt Key: query_engine:response_synthesizer:summary_templateText: Prompt Key: lookahead_answer_inserter:answer_insert_promptText: Analyze Prompts: LLMMultiSelector Prompt Key: promptText: Analyze Prompts:
